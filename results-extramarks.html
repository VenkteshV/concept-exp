the crack band approach for producing mesh 
independent load–displacement curves for fracture in plain concrete 
is based on the idea that the crack opening is transformed into inelastic 
strain by distributing it over an element length dependent zone [5]. 
this approach will only produce mesh independent load–displacement curves, 
if the <b style="background-color:rgba(0,255,255,1.0)"><b style="background-color:rgba(0,255,255,1.0)">inelastic strain</b> profiles</b> in the finite element analysis are mesh size dependent. 
this requirement is an important difference to the nonlocal model which is designed to produce both 
mesh size independent load–displacement curves and strain profiles. in cdpm2, the crack band approach is 
applied only to the <b style="background-color:rgba(0,255,255,1.0)">tensile part</b> of the damage algorithm by replacing the stress–<b style="background-color:rgba(0,255,255,1.0)"><b style="background-color:rgba(0,255,255,1.0)">inelastic strain</b> law</b> shown in fig. 2(b) 
by a stress–<b style="background-color:rgba(0,255,255,1.0)">inelastic displacement law</b> of the form(13)σ=ftexp(−ϵinhwft)if(ϵin>0)here, wft is a crack opening threshold used 
to control the slope of the softening curve and h is the width of the crack-band, which in the present study is equal to 
the maximum dimension of the element along the principal direction of the <b style="background-color:rgba(0,255,255,1.0)">strain tensor</b> corresponding to the maximum tensile 
principal strain at the onset of damage. 
for the <b style="background-color:rgba(0,255,255,1.0)">compressive part</b>, a stress–<b style="background-color:rgba(0,255,255,1.0)"><b style="background-color:rgba(0,255,255,1.0)">inelastic strain</b> law</b> was used to determine
the <b style="background-color:rgba(0,255,255,1.0)">compressive damage parameter</b>, since it was reported in [14] for columns 
subjected to eccentric compression that <b style="background-color:rgba(0,255,255,1.0)"><b style="background-color:rgba(0,255,255,1.0)">inelastic strain</b> profiles</b> in compression do 
not exhibit a <b style="background-color:rgba(0,255,255,1.0)">mesh dependence</b> which would satisfy the assumptions of the crack-band approach. 
this approach of applying the crack-band approach only to the <b style="background-color:rgba(0,255,255,1.0)">tensile part</b> has already been successfully used in grassl et al. [16]
